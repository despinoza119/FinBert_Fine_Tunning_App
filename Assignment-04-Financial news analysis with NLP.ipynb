    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the statistical analysis of simple sentiment\n",
    "cues. Essentially, it involves making statistical analyses on polarized\n",
    "statements (i.e., statements with a positive, negative and neutral sen\n",
    "timent), which are usually collected in the form of social media posts,\n",
    "reviews, and news articles. Financial sentiment analysis is a challenging task due to the specialized language and lack of labeled data in that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will focus on two different tasks.\n",

    "topics = {\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have downloaded the model, run inference and compute performance metrics to get a sense of how the specialized pre-trained model fares against the baseline  model.  Use the HuggingFaces library to download the model and run inference on it. For large datasets or text sequences, CPU running time might be large.\n",

    "#### **2.3 (Advanced) Fine-tune a pre-trained model such a base BERT model on a small labeled dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "General-purpose models are not effective enough because of the specialized language used in a financial context. We hypothesize that pre-trained language models can help with this problem because they require fewer labeled examples and they can be further trained on domain-specific corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years the NLP community has seen many breakthoughs in Natural Language Processing, especially the shift to transfer learning. Models like ELMo, fast.ai's ULMFiT, Transformer and OpenAI's GPT have allowed researchers to achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks and provided the community with large pre-trained models with high performance. This shift in NLP is seen as NLP's ImageNet moment, a shift in computer vision a few year ago when lower layers of deep learning networks with million of parameters trained on a specific task can be reused and fine-tuned for other tasks, rather than training new networks from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant milestones in the evolution of NLP recently is the release of Google's BERT, which is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In our case, we are going to explore a pre-trained model called FinBERT, already tuned with a financial corpus. I specifically recommend the HuggingFace library for easeness of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is HuggingFace?* Hugging Faceâs Transformers is an open-source library that provides thousands of pre-trained models to perform various tasks on texts such as text classification, named entity recognition, translation, and more. The library has a unified, high-level API for these models and supports a wide range of languages and model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are various tutorials for finetuning BERT: https://drlee.io/fine-tuning-hugging-faces-bert-transformer-for-sentiment-analysis-69b976e6ac5d and https://skimai.com/fine-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis/. I specially recommnend this one: http://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/\n",

    "The dataset where to finetune a BERT related model can be found in the previous cell: **Financial tweets topics dataset** \n",
    "\n",
    "*ALERT*: Running or training a large language model like BERT or FinBERT might incur in large CPU processing times. Although BERT is very large, complicated, and have millions of parameters, we might only need to fine-tune it in only 2-4 epochs. You can also explore Google colab, for limited acces to free GPUs, which might best suited for this task., specially if training required.\n",

    "\n",
    "LetÂ´s now turn our attention to a live deployment of the financial news tagger. Things can get quite complicated, specially if we add streaming data, so it is best to keep the deploymnet lightweight. There are mainly three important pieces. LetÂ´s explore them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a local dashboard/app (e.g. using Streamlit or another web applications framework of your choice). A bit UI to display the sentiment tagger in action and demonstrate the practical application of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a financial news/alerts scraper pipeline, filter some entities if you focus your search. In a real world setting,  youâd likely want to build a more robust infrastructure for processing and ingestion of new examples, handling any preprocessing, and outputting predictions. Here are some options where to scrape data (real-time data might be expensive or limited):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:blue\">*Social Media Posts*</span>: Pulling historical or live data from tweets or reddit. There are public APIs with extensive documentation for them.\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:blue\">*OpenBB*</span>: Open research investment platform. It aggregates financial news across the world and has an API to access them.\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:blue\">*Financial news outlet*</span>: Yahoo Finance\n",
    "    \n",
    "An pipeline example: The basic premise is to read in a stream of tweets, use a lighweight sentiment analysis engine (BERT might not be a good fit here) to assign a bullish/neutral/bearish score to each tweet, and then see how this cumulatively changes over time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Build an inference endpoint for the tagging model. Within your infrastructure, you can deploy and load the resuting model. One way is to build a REST API endpoint, only to be queried locally (in your laptop).\n",
